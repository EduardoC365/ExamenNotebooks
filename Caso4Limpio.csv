You'll often need to break down large problems into smaller more manageable tasks and utilize critical thinking to come up with novel ideas.  3+ years of engineering experience Things move quickly in the data group. You�ll need to be comfortable and familiar with delivering highly scalable cloud based applications.  Professional experience with frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, or similar This will be a significant component of your responsibilities. You will be working with large data sets in a distributed environment on a daily basis. Familiarity w/ the Hadoop/Spark ecosystem is a must.  Professional experience with Python data tools Our data team uses PySpark and Jupyter notebooks extensively. Familiarity with these technologies will also serve you well.  Direct experience with relational and NoSQL databases technologies We use the best tool for the job around here. When it comes to storing and accessing data, we recognize that the technology decisions we make directly impact our ability to provide a performant customer experience, and our own costs.  Experience designing and building JSON based RESTful APIs Because we are building our application with a front end framework, we carefully design and document the APIs to power it. To help us, we follow the JSON API spec, but any experience in building a RESTful API will be useful. Remember, the API is your contract with the consumers of your data!  Understanding of monolithic and micro-service based architectures IZEAx still has some legacy monolithic characteristics. We move more and more of our technology to a distributed set of services, there are new challenges to overcome. Understanding the differences between these two models will help you take those challenges head on.  Basic Linux skills In order to develop our data pipelines and services, you need to run it on your laptop. This means opening up some terminal windows, running some commands, and keeping the log output open. Additionally, some of our technology stack is better accessed through CLIs. Examples include the Ember CLI, the Rails CLI/console, Docker commands, Gradle, and our own CLIs. We'll walk you through it, but you should be comfy in a terminal.  Ability to multitask and prioritize multiple incoming requests IZEA's Engineering team strives to provide a great experience and great service to our users. In order to do that, you may need to context switch into a support issue or drop what you are doing to start work on something else. This is part of what Agile means to us.  Excellent verbal and written communications skills Regular and timely communication is the key to a trust based development process. You should be able to simply and concisely ask for feedback and direction in terms that your audience understands, and relay requested information in a timely fashion to your leaders. You should prioritize documentation of processes and code.  Demonstrated experience with the following will be highly valued  Data Science Background While not required, a fundamental understanding of statistics and modeling would be a great asset. Practical experience with Machine Learning and/or complex data pipelines would also be welcome.  Front End development experience From time to time you may need to build visualization, or (lite) user facing experiences. Familiarity with modern web frameworks like Angular, React, Ember, or Vue would be helpful. Extra bonus points if you have familiarity w/ Javascript based visualization libraries like d3.js or Highcharts.  Amazon Web Services, or other cloud providers IZEA's software is hosted on AWS, and you will need to acquire some familiarity with it. Previous experience in using a cloud provider, even if just for developer tooling, shows that you understand some of the nuances involved in working in the cloud. Familiarity with Amazon�s EMR would also be an asset.  Continuous Integration & Deployment IZEA needs to get features and fixes out to customers as soon as we possibly can with as much confidence as possible. To facilitate this, we have developed a CI/CD pipeline (using 3rd party services). An understanding of what CI/CD is will help you understand how this pipeline works and how to make it even better.

Unlike traditional workflow automation tools RPA systems develop the action list by watching the user perform that task in the applications graphical user interface (GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI. This can lower the barrier to use of automation in products that might not otherwise feature APIs for this purpose.  RPA tools have strong technical similarities to graphical user interface testing tools. These tools also automate interactions with the GUI, and often do so by repeating a set of demonstration actions performed by a user. RPA tools differ from such systems including features that allow data to be handled in and between multiple applications, for instance, receiving email containing an invoice, extracting the data, and then typing that into a bookkeeping system  The Role:  The need is for multiple Data Scientists who also are versed in Machine Learning.

The right candidate will have both a solid fundamental understanding and deep practical experience with at least a few modeling and machine learning techniques.  You should have experience building models that are used by people to make better decisions. We're focused on shipping early and often. We prefer iterative solutions that are incrementally better to the perfect solution.  How you will make a difference:   Analyze large data sets (we're collecting billions of individual actions every month). Build models and ship products that enable businesses to grow faster and communicate with their customers. Democratize and open up that technology to everyone (Our background as a team is building these models for the Fortune 50). Match the right assumptions and models to the right problem. Measure and know what impact your models had on the decisions people made -- e.g. did they outperform the previous best model or a human decision maker?  Who You Are:   Bachelor's or advanced degree in statistics, applied mathematics, computer science or other relevant quantitative discipline, or equivalent industry experience. Have worked in a data science role for 5+ years professionally or academically and can talk about your projects and the techniques you used. Have a strong fundamental understanding and deep experience with at least a few machine learning algorithms (e.g. regressions, decision trees, k-means clustering, neural networks). Understand Bayesian modeling techniques. Are capable of analyzing data and making rigorous statements about what can or cannot be concluded. Have experience designing and implementing model performance/validation assessments. Have a background in statistics and understand different distributions and the conditions under which they're valid. Know how code and have used data science tools and packages. Have demonstrated a measurable impact based on the models you've created. It's not always easy getting a model correct and we love talking about places we got stuck and working as a team to think through ideas that could unblock us. Have a desire to ship features powered by data science (in other words, you're excited by both upfront research and actually getting models into production at cloud scale).
